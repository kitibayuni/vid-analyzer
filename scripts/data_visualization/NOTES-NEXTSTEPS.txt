Next steps:
create transcript -> python process_transcript.py separated/htdemucs/example/vocals.wav --model medium --output something.csv

create mutation of pitch process for:
volume/audio energy
speechbrain?? (emotion detection) maybe use pitch data to infer emotion

adjust process so that audio -> speech only, background only, normalized (for pitch??)
